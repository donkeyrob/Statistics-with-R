Evaluating the Implementation of Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELNs) in a Biotechnology Course
Introduction
Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELNs) have been used as a tool to help students learning in their lab courses in recent years. Traditionally in those science laboratory courses, students use paper notebooks to take notes, record observation data, take pictures or plot results. Compared to a tradition notebook, an ELN is less time consuming, more organized, easy to access and easy to embed images. Moreover, electronic laboratory notebook simplifies data copy and backups and it supports collaboration between many users. Despite their advantages over traditional notebooks, no study has directly tested Electronic Laboratory Notebooks performance among researchers. The purpose of our study is to find out whether the ELNs format improves their students grades and how effective of ELNs on improving the quality of their students’ study. 
To evaluate the implementation of electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) in a biotechnology class at a large research university, two faculty members performed electronic pre/post-surveys with their students over four semesters to evaluate their experience with using electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) compared to using the traditional paper-based laboratory notebook format. We are particularly interested in judging the statistical significance of their responses to Likert scale questions. 
To study whether the ELNs format improves students’ grades, the grades of students’ notebooks report during two semesters have also been recorded. We evaluate any differences in their lab report grades between electronic notebook and traditional paper-based laboratory notebook.
